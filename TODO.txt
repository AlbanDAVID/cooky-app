## TODO ##

Priority :
- Size screen issue (for little screen)
- are sure to leave the page (create recipe)
- Fix photo bug (5% of the time, the app crash when we take a picture (come back to home page screen, error : Lost device connection))
- Categories name and the text "Cooky" in the app bar are not aligned

Code :
- Refacto

Transaltion :
- Any new language translation is welcome

UI :
- Improve UI

Bugs :
- minor : indentation : when we add a new step after other steps have been created (step 1, step 2 (while there are already step 1 and 2 for example, we would have to repeat the indentation in relation to the elements already added))
- minor : when I delete a field in recipe create and I delete, then I edit: I see the "delete" in the text field to edit
